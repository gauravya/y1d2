        <p>
            From February 07, 2025, I solemnly swear to never use a Large Langauge Model (LLM) to write anything on this blog. I have prior to this date used it to clean up my writing. 
            Nothing here has not been my own idea, but LLMs have definetely helped me say things more clearly. 
            I think AI systems are going to be what lead to our end as a humanity. As so on that level, out of spite, I will no longer be using it to write here.
            I also think that my writing would greatly benefit from me giving up LLMs, and while it may lead to posts that are 'rough' in nature, it does not matter.

            Sincerly,
            Gaurav Yadav.

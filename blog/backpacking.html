        <p>
          I recently hauled myself on a 20-day trek through the Slovakian and
          Polish mountains. My 65-L backpack tipped the airport scales at a
          whopping 18 kg. Jack got stuck with our shared tent, first aid kit,
          and other group gear, so it's safe to say most of my pack weight was,
          you guessed it, food.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am going to talk a bit about food for backpacking here. This was my
          first time doing something like this, and so I am by no means an
          expert and have a bunch to learn. It is also worth noting that I am
          not a nutritionist, and everyone's bodies and specifically their guts
          are different. Most of the time you should always try to disagree with
          or inquire about advice you hear, even if it is 'common sense'. At
          least this way you're actively trying to make up your mind on things.
        </p>

        <h3>What I took</h3>

        <h4>Breakfast</h4>
        <p>
          Let's start with breakfast. Every morning, I had a decent-sized
          flapjack - not just any flapjack, mind you, but my own homemade
          creation. Lots of sugar and fats to kick-start the day.
        </p>

        <p>
          Breakfast is generally a challenging meal for me. I don't particularly
          enjoy it, but after hours on the trail, I'd wake up each morning with
          a sickening growl in my stomach. The flapjack was a good call in that
          regard: soft, tasty, and easy to get down. It was also convenient. I
          wake up most mornings with low energy, and cooking something takes
          effort and time when I'd much rather eat quickly, relax, and prepare
          to head off. Others would make morning porridge, but I dislike it
          quite a bit.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, flapjacks weren't without issues. While dense and heavy, they
          didn't leave me full for long. We typically woke up at 6 AM, and I
          would eat a flapjack around then, so the quick onset of hunger was
          predictable. They also cause a significant glucose spike, followed by
          a crash a few hours later. I mitigated this somewhat by having coffee
          too, which helped keep me going, but it remained a concern.
        </p>

        <p>
          Reflecting on this, I'm inclined to keep flapjacks in my breakfast
          rotation for future treks, but I'm also keen to diversify. For me, the
          ideal trail breakfast should offer sustained fullness, steady energy
          release, and healthy fats.
        </p>

        <h4>Lunch</h4>
        <p>
          Lunches on the trail were a delicate balancing act. My go-to trio -
          nuts, oat bars, and sweets - seemed like a hiker's dream but often
          left me wanting. The morning's flapjacks, while delicious, set the
          stage for a midday appetite that was hard to satisfy. Snacks would
          quiet the rumbling beast in my stomach, but only temporarily.
        </p>

        <p>
          The idea of sitting down to cook a proper lunch was going to be
          impractical. Quick and easy was our mantra, but it came at a cost. In
          hindsight, I should've bought wraps and nut butter with me. Carbs, it
          turns out, sticks around in my body for a while. My pre-salted nuts,
          once thought to be a hydration faux pas, turned out to be
          electrolyte-replacing heroes. But even heroes can overstay their
          welcome. There's a limit to how many peanuts one can consume before
          contemplating a life without them.
        </p>

        <p>
          For me, fullness trumps calories whilst out. When you're teetering on
          the edge of hangry, with miles to go and mountains to climb, feeling
          satisfied becomes paramount. A well-fed hiker is a happy hiker. Next
          time, I'll prioritise satiety over calorie counts - my feet, and my
          stomach, will thank me.
        </p>

          />
        </div>

        <h4>Dinner</h4>
        <p>Dinners had more variety. This is what I carried:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>5 pouches of Firepot's Vegan Orzo Bolognese</li>
          <li>3 TentCamp meals (2 Almond Jalfrezi and 1 Thai Green Curry)</li>
          <li>5 of my own culinary creations</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          My homemade meals usually featured couscous or noodles, and definitely
          included TVP (textured vegetable protein) with some sort of seasoning,
          an assortment of nuts, and coconut flakes. Gourmet backpacking at its
          finest. These were all prepped before we left, neatly packed into
          ziplock bags – just add hot water and voila! TVP takes a little while
          to actually cook so usually I would pour in water and close the
          ziplock bag and let it cook for 15 minutes.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're at Bristol uni, check out the Hungry Caterpillar Co-op, you
          can buy TVP from them. If not them, your local organic food store
          probably has it too.
        </p>

        <p>
          The noodles were a highlight. I found Masala Maggi! An Indian classic,
          which once was found to contain lead and caused a big scandal. Alas,
          it was comfort food and far more delicious than I remembered, probably
          because all the hiking and sun exposure made food taste nicer in the
          evenings.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Firepot and TentCamp meals were poor. Most dehydrated meals won't
          be good, but the bolognese was frankly awful. The TentCamp meals were
          fine but tasted fairly bland. If I were doing this again, I'd stick to
          making all of my meals on my own. These pre-prepped meals cost me £5-6
          each, and the return on value was bad. There's a chance other Firepot
          meals options out there are better, so maybe in hindsight, I shouldn't
          have bought five of the same ones.
        </p>

        <h3>Some lessons learnt</h3>

        <h4>Weight</h4>
        <p>
          You want your rucksack to be as light as possible. You want to
          prioritise having dried foods. Things that you can easily cook with
          boiling water. This means no canned foods, no fresh produce, and
          definitely no glass jars. If you want something fresh, consider buying
          it during your trip.
        </p>

        <p>
          Noodles, couscous, and TVP are your new best friends - light, compact,
          and calorie-dense.
        </p>

        <p>
          I brought two jars of peanut butter and didn't touch them. At 300g
          each, that was a costly weight penalty to carry around unused. I am
          not a particularly big fan of PB, but peanuts are an efficient way of
          getting calories in so I thought I could hack it. Lesson learned.
        </p>

        <h4>Location</h4>
        <p>
          I packed as if Slovakia was a food desert, only to discover it's more
          of a vegan-friendly oasis. Who knew? From the surprisingly
          well-stocked Lidl in Terchová (complete with a dedicated vegan aisle,
          no less) to mountain huts in the Tatras and shops in Pieniny, Poland,
          food was far more accessible than I'd imagined.
        </p>

        <p>
          Those pricey Firepot and TentCamp meals? They could have stayed at
          home while I saved cash and went local. Even if you're sceptical about
          vegan options in unfamiliar territory, big chain supermarkets often
          come through. A little homework goes a long way in lightening your
          pack and fattening your wallet.
        </p>

          class="blog-image"
        />

        <h4>Supplements</h4>
        <p>
          If you're vegan, then you also probably need some way of getting in
          B12, Iron and Omega-3. Deficiencies in these can be horrible, trust
          me. They are easy to offset of course, so consider carrying
          supplements with you even if it's a short trip. I didn't. I regret it.
        </p>

        <h4>Timing your food intake</h4>
        <p>
          In my experience, my internal metabolic clock seems to adapt to my
          eating habits. I often feel hungry at the same time if I keep up
          eating at a certain point. This is of course easy to control when I'm
          waking up, but harder to do when there's more unpredictability with
          when I'm coming to hiking and knowing when I'll reach certain points
          and camps.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've found it useful to try and time my food intake at specific
          intervals of the day. For instance, I like to have a bit of food just
          before the start of my hike. I also try to eat something near or at
          the top of a summit, and I make sure to have something to eat during a
          descent. These aren't hard and fast rules, but rather patterns I've
          noticed work well for me.
        </p>

        <p>
          If I'm consistent with when I'm starting walks, and if my backpacking
          trip is long enough, I've learned to manage hunger pangs better. My
          body seems to adjust to the new routine over time, making energy
          management more predictable as the trip progresses. Of course, every
          hike is different, and I always try to listen to my body and adjust as
          needed.
        </p>

        <h4>Stashing Food</h4>
        <p>
          As someone who's neurodivergent, I find certain aspects of hiking
          uniquely challenging. One of these is the constant on-and-off with my
          heavy rucksack. It's not just the weight; the sensation of putting on
          a backpack against my sweaty, then cooling back is particularly
          uncomfortable.
        </p>

        <p>
          To minimise this discomfort and make snacking more convenient, I've
          developed a strategy. I use the front pockets of my rucksack to stash
          easily accessible food for lunch and quick snacks. This way, I can
          grab a bite without the ordeal of removing and replacing my pack. I'm
          even considering investing in a 1L waist belt solely for food storage.

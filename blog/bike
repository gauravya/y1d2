<p> I did it!
I learnt how to balance on a bike.
It has taken many decades to get here.
Two in fact. </p>

<p> My father had long tried to get me to ride a bike.
But I was too afraid to fall.
I would ask for assisted wheels on either side to help me stay balanced.
The bike shops we went to would look at us funny.
'Why does this teenager need assisted wheels?'
They would say. 
I gave up hope on ever learning to ride a bike as a kid.
Who cares anyways?
I can use my feet.
 </p>

<p>I didn't really try at university, either.
  My first summer job in Oxford lent bikes.
  I was unfortunately far too self-conscious to waddle around.</p>

<p> Early this year, Seb sold me a bike.
  Before purchasing it, I found a Â£20 note on the ground near Bristol Cathedral.
  I used that money to buy the bike.</p>

     <div style="text-align: center">
        <img src="/images/bike.jpg" style="max-width: 50%; height: auto" />
      </div>

<p>And as such, it was named 'A Bike from God'.
The holy bike, unfortunately, was not self-balancing.
Here is a video of my attempt.</p>

              <source src="/videos/bike.mp4" type="video/mp4">
              Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
          </div>
        </div>

<p>Ruby, the recorder of the above video, tried to teach me.
Alas, I think this was a poor bike to start learning on.
I could have, also, benefited from pushing down with my right foot.
I tried, I failed. I tried, and failed again.
And then the bike was stolen.</p>

<p>But, finally, after many attempts the nice people at <a href = "https://www.bikeforgood.org.uk/get-cycling/cycle-training/">Bike For Good</a>, have taught me.
  AJ and Stanley. 
 (Stanley used to be in Theatre industry before this!)
I was able to start, balance, and stop (albeit nervously).
I am still very scared of hitting people with my bike.
But I could mostly navigate amongst the crowds walking in Kelvingrove Park.</p>

<p>It is hard to describe what this feeling is.
Pride.
Yes, pride.</p>

<p>I am not yet there to start going on roads.
But this confidence will snowball and soon, I'll be mountain biking.</p>

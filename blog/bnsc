          A couple of local dance clubs recently asked around for ideas on how
          to get more people through the door. I'm no expert, but I've noticed
          the Bristol Northern Soul Club (BNSC) is doing pretty well. Other
          groups might want to take a look at what they're up to.
        </p>

          I went to a Northern Soul beginners workshop not too long ago. The
          place was packed - you could barely move without bumping into someone,
          and drinks were sloshing everywhere. But despite the squeeze, everyone
          was having a blast. The main event after was just as crowded and
          lively.
        </p>

        <div class="video-container">
          <iframe
            width="800"
            height="450"
            src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lXCBdbIZMdA"

            allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"
            allowfullscreen
          ></iframe>
        </div>

        <p>
          I'm not deep in the Northern Soul scene, so I'm just guessing based on
          what I've seen, but a few things jump out about why it's gotten so
          popular:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The BNSC knows how to use social media. Their Instagram and Facebook
            are full of cool photos and videos of dancers, and they've nailed
            that retro vibe that seems to pull in younger folks.
          </li>
          <li>
            They post a lot of videos of people dancing to soul music. When you
            watch them, you can see everyone having a great time, which makes
            you want to join in. It's catchy in a way that photos or words just
            can't match.
          </li>
          <li>
            Levanna Mclean, who runs the BNSC, has really put herself out there.
            She's in ads, shows up on local news, does interviews, and has
            racked up a bunch of views on YouTube.
          </li>
          <li>
            Interestingly, Northern Soul is mainly a solo dance. Unlike Lindy or
            Contra, you don't need to find a partner. That takes away a big
            hurdle for new dancers - you don't have to work up the nerve to ask
            someone to dance. You just need to get yourself out on the floor.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          But you know, I'm not sure becoming popular is always the best move
          for dance clubs. Popularity comes with trade-offs. Generally, the more
          people you bring in, the more likely you are to run into problems. You
          also start to lose control over the vibe of your events.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the flip side, of course, you get to introduce more people to the
          thing you love doing. That's pretty cool. I think there are some
          interesting bits to pick up from what the BNSC is doing if you're
          looking to spread the word. But it's worth thinking hard about what
          you really want for your dance scene to look like. Paying more
          attention to this and then thinking about how you can attract those
          kinds of people is probably the best philosophy around this.

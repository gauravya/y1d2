            Some days, Tom speaks about fighting battles we know we'll lose.
            Like his quest to end all suffering in our world, human and non-human alike.
            We lose this battle every single day, he and I.
            Yet we keep fighting, because we must.
            </p>
            <p>
            Another battle worth fighting is against life's suboptimal parts.
            And oh, how suboptimal the internet has become.
            The endless ads, mind-numbing short-form content, waves of misinformation - it's exhausting.
            I dream of a more wholesome internet.
            One where I can simply read my friends' thoughts without ads force-fed into my consciousness.
            Where disagreements with strangers can unfold with nuance and empathy.
            This version of the internet - this is worth fighting for.
            And so I joined Bluesky.
            </p>
            <p>
            My pessimism tells me it won't last.
            Taking on the social media giants feels like another losing battle.
            Look at Mastodon - it never quite took flight.
            Even X's problems may not be enough to make Bluesky truly compete.
            But Bluesky represents the internet I want to see.
            So I must support these valiant efforts.

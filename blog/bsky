        <p>
        Some days, Tom speaks about fighting battles we know we'll lose.
        Like his quest to end all suffering in our world, human and non-human alike.
        We lose this battle every single day, he and I.
        Yet we keep fighting, because we must.
        </p>

        <p>
        Another battle worth fighting is against life's suboptimal parts.
        And oh, how suboptimal the internet has become.
        The endless ads, mind-numbing short-form content, waves of misinformation - it's exhausting.
        I dream of a more wholesome internet.
        One where I can simply read my friends' thoughts without ads force-fed into my consciousness.
        Where disagreements with strangers can unfold with nuance and empathy.
        This version of the internet - this is worth fighting for.
        And so I joined Bluesky.
        </p>

        <p>
        My pessimism tells me it won't last.
        Taking on the social media giants feels like another losing battle.
        Look at Mastodon - it never quite took flight.
        Even X's problems may not be enough to make Bluesky truly compete.
        But Bluesky represents the internet I want to see.
        So I must support these valiant efforts.

          Tom and I have been pondering how to make friends as adults. One
          solution he has invented is CultFrisbee™. Here's how you play:
        </p>

        <h3>Rules:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You need at least one other player.</li>
          <li>Before catching a frisbee, you must clap.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fouls:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Not catching a 'properly' thrown frisbee</li>
          <li>Failing to make a 'proper' throw</li>
          <li>Not clapping before catching the frisbee</li>
          <li>Clapping when a frisbee isn't thrown to you</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Every time you foul, you get a letter, which spells out the word
          "Cult." Your first foul earns you a C, second a U, and so on. If you
          complete the word "Cult," you must approach someone and ask them to
          join a game of CultFrisbee.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, we managed to meet about 15 different people at the Glasgow
          Botanical Gardens and found two who gave us their numbers to stay in
          touch. Those are pretty good odds.

        <h2>Dancing in a Bar</h2>
        <div class="date">2024-07-25</div>

        <p>Within a space of ten by ten,</p>
        <p>You can dance solo or bring a friend.</p>
        <p>Throw shapes and moves with all your might,</p>
        <p>From swing to waltz, your steps can be right.</p>
        <p>Break dance or hip hop, give it a shot,</p>
        <p>In this square, you've got the perfect spot.</p>
        <br />

        <p>Though if you're aiming to groove across the floor,</p>
        <p>A ten-by-ten just leaves you wanting more.</p>
        <p>If setting the mood is your goal,</p>
        <p>That square footage might cramp your soul.</p>
        <br />

        <p>But hey, not every day is your day.</p>
        <p>Sometimes you're stuck in a bar,</p>
        <p>Tunes are blaring from afar and you're ready to start.</p>
        <p>Might as well make the most of this night.</p>
        <p>That 10x10's shrunk, the space isn't right.</p>
        <p>But your body's ready to move with all its might.</p>
        <br />

        <p>The eyes watch you as you go,</p>
        <p>They wonder at your rhythm and flow.</p>
        <p>They think you're trained, a dancing pro,</p>
        <p>But you're just having fun, letting it show.</p>
        <p>No need for fancy shoes or technique,</p>
        <p>When your moves make the floor unique.</p>
        <br />

        <p>Then it's time to head on out,</p>
        <p>Sweat-soaked from your dancing bout.</p>
        <p>Some ask for your number, some just stare,</p>
        <p>Your moves have left them all aware.</p>
        <p>But as the night fades, doubts creep in,</p>
        <p>"Do I dance for me or them?" you wonder within.</p>

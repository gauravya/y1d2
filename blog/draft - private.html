        <h2>The Months in Glasgow</h2>
        <div class="date">2024-x</div>

        <p>
          I left the love of my life a few months ago.
          Bristol.
          My university city.
          It felt like my first proper city.
          I was reborn almost.
          I had new hobbies, a new style, more self-esteem.
          I truly loved it.
          Never has a city kept me so entertained.
          If you wanted, you could never get bored.
          A dance class there, friend for coffee here, someone on crack there.
          The city has a reputation for being 'edgy', 'quirky', 'off-beat'.
          More often than not it will live up to it.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you must know another fact about Bristol then here it is.
          The city is expensive.
          Living there does not come easy.
          It is not as bad as London, but give it enough time and it might get there.
          It all checks out, of course.
          The first fact, the abundance of things to do, feeds into the second.
          People who love the city will do what they can to persist.
          It seems that one doesn't leave Bristol until they have to.
        </p>

        <p>
          I decided to quit Bristol.
          Perhaps circumstantially.
          My tenancy was running out and I wasn't sure where I was going next after I graduated.
          I vividly remember milking every second of the last few days I had.
          A sign that I did not want to let go.
          But then I did.
          I had to let go, and move.
          And move I did.
          TO SCOTLAND!!!
          The cold, grey city of Glasgow.
          I was warned that I would get stabbed if I lived in Glasgow.
          Such suspicions have not come to fruition yet.
        </p>

        <p>
          It feels hard articulating into words how I feel about this city.
          It's been over two months.
          There is a charm here.
          A feeling of welcomeness.
          I have felt at home.
          I have felt comfortable.
        </p>

        <p>
          I grew up being fed a desire for a 'sexy' life.
          A 'sexy' life is a life in the Manhattan skyscrapers.
          Where you wake up next to someone pretty, with an electric curtain slowly unveiling a gorgeous sunrise.
          This life is in most Indian people's consciousness.
          Perhaps not exactly what I wrote.
          But something close enough.
          You grew up thinking that things were never enough.
          You were always climbing to the top.
          Always fighting your way to things.
          Most people in India lack any sense of self-conviction.
          Your self-worth is always defined by someone else's perception of you.
          This is of course a sad fact that burdens more than just the Indian subcontinent.
        </p>

        <p>
          I don't think many of my friends even know where Glasgow is.
          'No, Scotland is not a city.'
          I have failed to live the 'sexy' life.
          I wake up most days on a futon, bumbling around, doing an unstructured assortment of activities.
          I don't work at a bank.
          My law degree did not make me a lawyer.
          I can't let go of the memes fed to me.
          But I can at least enjoy what is happening.
        </p>

        <p>
          It feels a bit strange that Glasgow is causing me to have profound insights.
          But I don't really think the specific city matters.
          Glasgow is just a placeholder in some respects.
          I feel like putting my life on pause, and starting over is what feels like is more pertinent.
        </p>

        <p>
          But is it just a placeholder?
          Glasgow has such a vibrance.
          I am currently writing this at a lovely public library.
          Later on I will have dinner with some vegan runners.
          Yesterday, I went Blues dancing in a room that has a stark red ambience.
          Not far from Glasgow is the sunny Edinburgh, with an abundance of things to do as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eventually I will have to decide where next?
          I could see myself living here for a while.
          I could see myself going back to Bristol.
          Really, I could see myself in most English cities.
          Perhaps then it is not the city, but the people that live there. 
          Having friends to see, communities to feel apart of.
          When I think about going back to Bristol, I sometimes think about the easy access to Nature.
          The friends I had through dancing.
          But I can have that here too.
          I can try and have that anywhere.
        </p>

        <p>
          Is it then 
        </p>

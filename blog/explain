<p> Calling dances is hard work.
    My view of great dance calling has changed completely these past months.
    I once thought perfect timing made a good caller.
    Selecting fun dances felt just as important.
    Both skills matter, but they're not the heart of it.
    The best callers explain complex moves with perfect clarity and minimal words.</p>

<p>For Contra Dances:
    Find a partner and both face toward the stage.
    Another couple will stand in front of you - these are your neighbors.
    In improper formation, larks stand on the left side of the line, robyns on the right.
    Join hands in a circle with your neighbor and partner.
    This forms your group of four, or "hands four.</p>

<p>You're facing either up or down the hall - this is your direction of progression.
    You'll move in this direction after each time through the dance.
    When you reach the end of the line, you'll turn around and progress in the opposite direction.
    If you get lost, just remember which way you're progressing.
    Your next neighbors are the couple beyond your current neighbors in your direction of progression.</p>
    
<p>Ok so all of that is pretty wordy. Perhaps a simpler version:
Find a partner.
Face up or down the hall - alternate with your neighbors.
Larks on left, robyns on right.
Join hands in a circle with the couple facing you.
If you can't take hands four, turn around.
You'll progress in your facing direction after each time through the dance.
At the line's end, turn around and progress the other way.</p>

I left my first love three months ago, today.
Bristol.
At 18, I knew very little about what Bristol was like.
At 19, I wanted to get out.
At 20, I couldn't see myself anywhere else.

I found friends eventually. I came to love the communities I was in.
It was in many ways, perfect.
A city that was home.
But, like many a graduates, I knew very little about where I was going after university.
And frankly, I needed time off. 
For all the love I had, the city gave me pain.
Highs and lows.
Bristol, was always one or the other.
Never boring.
Never dull.
But full of problems.
I felt like Bristol exhausted me, and I exhausted it. 

I was gifted the opportunity to move to Glasgow.
All the way from the South to the North.
I turned 21 in Glasgow, and knew very little about the city was like.

Having been here for three months, it suprises me how quickly I have felt at home.
People seem nicer here.
I am unsure if it's because everyone tells me they're nicer.
But there is a sense of warmth.
More smiles, even when the clouds are grey.
Sometimes it is hard to understand what the Glaswegian accent is telling me.

I found a community here too.
I found out how to be a grown up.
More so than at university.
I overhauled my wardrobe.
Started writing, drawing and singing more.
I learnt to ride a bike.
I learnt to fix a bike.

Glasgow has given me strong sense of exploration into me.
I'd like to move.
Go and live in a place for a few months, years at time.
Plant roots in different places.
Of course, Glasgow is perhaps unusual.
Not every city will be so charming and welcoming.
But, glasgow, you have taught me things.
Glasgow, you have changed me.

I miss Bristol.
The friends, the milder temperatures.
The unusual 'alternative' vibe the city has.
I do miss it.
But it'll be there, waiting.
For now I must go find out what is there in this world.

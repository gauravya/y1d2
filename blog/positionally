        <p>
            I have been attempting to call Contras positionally.
            I think there are some levels of definition to 'positional calling'.
            The first level is: a way to call without the use of roles.
            The second level: a form of calling to help dancers connect with the flow of a dance.
            
            I feel quite lucky stumbling on 'positional' as my first style of contra calling
            I have nothing to unlearn.
            I don't have instinctive reflex that makes want to say 'ladies-chain' or 'robins-chain.
            Positional calling has made it really abundantly clear to me that as a caller your job as a teacher is far more important.
            I need to have a strong sense of where everyone is, and where everyone is supposed to be going.
            
            I do think it has made calling to be a learning curve.
            I do think if I decided to call things with roles, it would still be hard.
            But positional calling ups it a little bit.
            Your instructions when calling positionally seems to increase.

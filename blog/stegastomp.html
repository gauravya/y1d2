          <a href="https://stegastomp.co.uk">Stegastomp</a> has come and gone,
          leaving behind memories of a raucous (!) contra dance weekend in a
          charming village hall near Warwick. The event featured incredible
          music by Contrasaurus (and their many friends), a band I've since
          learned has been

          This year has marked my foray into festivals. Having only just
          discovered folk music and dancing, I was initially hesitant to dive
          into the festival scene. However, with some encouragment from friends,
          I've now experienced my first
          <a href="https://ivfdf2024.org.uk/">IVFDF</a>,
          <a href="https://www.chippfolk.co.uk/">Chippenham Folk Festival</a>,
          and now Stegastomp.
        </p>

        <p>
          The journey to the Stomp began with Jeremy kindly offering a lift to
          the village hall. Our two-hour drive was pleasantly interrupted by a
          Thai stew I had cooked, which we enjoyed at a service station. Upon
          arrival, we were immediately swept into the festivities, with music
          and dancing already in full swing.
        </p>

          As I've engaged more with the UK folk world, I've come to appreciate
          certain aspects. People tend to be refreshingly direct, yet loving in
          their own way. There's a palpable sense of free self-expression that
          permeates the community. Of course, being new means encountering the
          'newcomer syndrome' - that feeling of being surrounded by people who
          all seem to know each other and you're a bit hesitant to interrupt
          conversations to introduce yourself.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's clear that many have been part of the folk scene for years, even
          decades, with friendships spanning just as long. This realisation
          initially made me feel out of place at Stegastomp, but I'm learning
          that becoming part of this community is a gradual process like
          everything else.
        </p>

          The weekend itself was exceptionally well organised. Charlotte, who
          runs Stegastomp, clearly knows her stuff – everything ran like a
          well-oiled machine.

          The calling and music were fantastic. Dancing with seasoned contra
          partners was a treat, making it easier to experiment with flourishes
          and role-switching. I particularly appreciated that this was a
          gender-free calling event, contrasting with my experience at
          Chippenham, where gendered calling sometimes caused confusion. While I
          prefer gender-free calling, I understand why those accustomed to years
          of gendered calling might find the Larks/Robins system challenging.
          <a href="http://louisesiddons.com">Louise Siddons</a> is calling at
          the next Stegastomp and does positional calling which gets rid of the
          need for terms like man/lady, larks/robins. I am curious to see how I
          find dancing to that.

          The evenings were anchored by tune sessions where musicians gathered
          to play folk music. These sessions provided the soundtrack for balfolk
          dancing, a style of European folk dance. In my experience, balfolk has
          a more relaxed and improvisational feel compared to some other dance
          forms. People brought various instruments to join the sessions. I
          brought my ukulele, feeling a bit out of place among the fiddles,
          accordions, and other typical folk instruments. It was impressive to
          see how quickly many musicians could pick up new tunes by ear - a
          skill I haven't mastered.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a newcomer to balfolk, I'm gradually getting more comfortable with
          it. While I still struggle with some of the more complex dances like
          the mazurka, I've found enjoyment in simpler forms such as bourrées
          and waltzes. What I appreciate about balfolk is its forgiving nature -
          it's okay to make mistakes and just find your way back to the rhythm.
        </p>

          The sessions often continued until midnight, which was challenging for
          me, especially on Saturday when I was ready for sleep. As I was
          camping indoors in the same space where the music was happening, it
          led to some late nights. Part of me wished for earlier endings, but
          the lively atmosphere was engaging.
        </p>

        <p>
          Saturday's workshops were excellent, offering both familiar material
          (like Charlie's workshop on connection) and challenging new
          experiences. Sunday's Playford workshop was less to my taste – I found
          the dances somewhat rigid and struggled to connect with them. However,
          the contra medley was a highlight, featuring an impressive hour and a
          half of non-stop dancing!

          I even got to try my hand at calling, leading the "Square Affair" by
          Becky Hill. I really enjoy calling – it feels like a skill that's fun
          to try and master. I asked around to see where I could have a go at
          calling more often and got some pretty good advice.

          Overall, Stegastomp was a lovely experience – an affordable contra
          festival packed with dancing. I'm look forward to the next one!

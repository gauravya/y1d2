      <p>
        A friend told me about militant vegans.
        How they make everyone feel bad from their moral high ground.
        I used to be one.
        With friends who thought the same, it was easy.
        I spent hours using philosophical jiu-jitsu to convert people.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then I wondered - does this actually help?
        Some googling and talking showed me the truth.
        My veganism barely dents the system.
        The factory farms keep running either way.
        So I dropped the crusade.
      </p>

      <p>
        I now pick up a new thesis.
        Money makes animals' lives better more effectively than arguments do.
        I used to think paying to offset guilt was cheating.
        That you must live up to your principles directly.
      </p>

      <p>
        But money can:
        <ul>
          <li><a href = "https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/donate">Get farmers to use stunners for shrimp (yes, shrimp!)</a></li>
          <li><a href = "https://thehumaneleague.org/">Convince major food companies to use only cage-free eggs</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.wildanimalinitiative.org/">Fund research to reduce wild animal suffering</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        That's living up to principles too.
        So no, I don't want you to become vegan.
        But if you can afford it, consider giving to charities that <a href = "https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charity-comparisons">efficiently</a> improve animals' lives.
      </p>

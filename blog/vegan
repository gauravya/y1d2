      <p>
        A friend was describing her experience with militant vegans.
        How they make everyone feel bad from their moral high ground.
        I used to be one.
        With friends who thought the same, it was easy.
        I spent hours using philosophical jiu-jitsu to convert people.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then I wondered - does this actually help?
        Eventually I had to drop the hat.
        My veganism was making a small dent.
        The crusade was over.
        Sure, less suffering was being caused in the world, but far too little to make a meaningful difference.
        Systems as large as factory farming don't shift from individual choices alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        I now pick up a new thesis.
        Money helps animals more than arguments.
        I used to think paying to offset guilt was cheating.
        That you must live up to your principles directly.
      </p>

      <p>
        But money can:
        <ul>
          <li><a href = "https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/donate">Get farmers to use stunners for shrimp (yes, shrimp!)</a></li>
          <li><a href = "https://thehumaneleague.org/">Convince major food companies to use only cage-free eggs</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.wildanimalinitiative.org/">Fund research to reduce wild animal suffering</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        That's living up to principles too.
        So no, I don't want you to become vegan.
        But if you can afford it, consider giving to charities that <a href = "https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charity-comparisons">efficiently</a> improve animals' lives.

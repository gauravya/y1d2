Notes:

"Every statement everyone says could be prefaced with a
disclaimer: “From my limited point of view, based only on
what I’ve experienced…”
But they don’t need to say that. Instead, we need to know
that, and hear it that way."

I like that it is a constant reminder.
People don't usually hedge when they talk.
At least not <a href = "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Psr9tnQFuEXiuqGcR/how-to-write-quickly-while-maintaining-epistemic-rigor"> all people.</a>

The world is as negotiable as a flea market in Marrakesh.
Only a fool doesn’t haggle.

Ask. 
I feel like lots of my life could be improved by 'haggling'.

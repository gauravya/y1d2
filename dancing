          Within a space of ten by ten,<br />
          You can dance solo or bring a friend.<br />
          Throw shapes and moves with all your might,<br />
          From swing to waltz, your steps can be right.<br />
          Break dance or hip hop, give it a shot,<br />
          In this square, you've got the perfect spot.
        </p>

        <p>
          Though if you're aiming to groove across the floor,<br />
          A ten-by-ten just leaves you wanting more.<br />
          If setting the mood is your goal,<br />
          That square footage might cramp your soul.
        </p>

        <p>
          But hey, not every day is your day.<br />
          Sometimes you're stuck in a bar,<br />
          Tunes blaring from afar and you're ready to start.<br />
          Might as well make the most of this night.<br />
          That 10x10's shrunk, the space isn't right.<br />
          But your body's ready to move with all its might.
        </p>

        <p>
          The eyes watch you as you go,<br />
          They wonder at your rhythm and flow.<br />
          They think you're trained, a dancing pro,<br />
          But you're just having fun, letting it show.<br />
          No need for fancy shoes or technique,<br />
          When your moves make the floor unique.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then it's time to head on out,<br />
          Sweat-soaked from your dancing bout.<br />
          Some are curious, some just gaze,<br />
          Your moves have left them all amazed.<br />
          But as the night dims and thoughts arise,<br />
          You wonder, "Do I dance for joy or for their eyes?"<br />

Lots of my friends are unaware of 'date-me documents'.
I was born after the OkCupid era, but someone described it as being similar to that.
You are essentially listing out in very meticulous detail about your dating desires.
It is a far cry from dating apps.
It is in fact a protest against modern dating.

There are a bunch of public date-me documents on the internet for you to peruse.
But a vague structure might be: a bio - name, age, height,
I do admire the people that have one up.
You are being vulnerable and open.
'Here I am, here is what I want.'
Very few do this.

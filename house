          <h2>House me in London?</h2>

          <p>
            The tradition of "date-me" documents is well established.
            But how about a "house-me" document?
            This short page details my housing needs.           
          </p>

          <p>
            I have been accepted as an AI Governance Fellow at Pivotal Research.
            The fellowship starts in February.
            I’ll likely work on questions surrounding AI Governance and the Law.

            I am looking for housing near the LISA office in Shoreditch.
            My budget is £1,000, but I’d love to come in under that.
            If necessary, I’m happy to pay a little more.
            The dates I’m looking for are 1st February to 6th April.

            I’d love to live in a space with a sense of community.
            Group meals, activities, and shared experiences are very important to me.
            I am agentic and extroverted in this regard.
            I love doing things with others.
            Living with people who share this vibe would be ideal.
          </p>

          <h2>What am I like to live with?</h2>

          <p>Perhaps if you have a spare room or are subletting your room in which case your flatmates are the relevant people here. You might want to know what it is like to live with me.
            I really enjoy my homespace. It is important to me, it is where I can feel safe and create in some sense a place for peace. To that extent I intend to keep spaces clean and in tip-top shape.
            It means you don't have to worry about me leaving dishes on the side, or not cleaning up after myself in communal spaces. Aside from that, I love when spaces can bring others together, I love having 
            friends over for (vegan) Dinners - at university I would do this a bunch and it provided with great fulfilmment! 
            I want to share meals with flatmates, have a sense of community in a flat, spend hours chatting to know others. Historically flatmates have resulted in greater friendships and bonds for me and this seems important.
            I appreciate that not everyone wants this and that is okay! I am still happy to live with people who aren't so keen on this either but I expect that results in less time spent inside the house.
          </p>

          <h2>What does my current housemate think of me?</h2>

          Tom Gardiner:
          
          <blockquote>“[They’re] open to suggestions and very amenable to live with.
          They don’t have a disruptive lifestyle.
          One flaw: a terrible wrap-folding technique!
          (We often make tofu and veggie wraps, and they don’t fold them tightly enough!)”

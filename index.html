          <a href="https://stegastomp.co.uk">Stegastomp</a> has come and gone,
          leaving behind memories of a raucous (!) contra dance weekend in a
          charming village hall near Warwick. The event featured incredible
          music by Contrasaurus and their many friends, a band I've since

          This year marks my first foray into folk festivals. Having only
          discovered folk music and dancing last year, I was initially hesitant
          to dive into the festival scene. However, I've now experienced my
          first <a href="https://ivfdf2024.org.uk/">IVFDF</a> in York, my first
          <a href="https://www.chippfolk.co.uk/">Chippenham Folk Festival</a>,
          and now Stegastomp. With each event, I feel more connected to this
          vibrant community.

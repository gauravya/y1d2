      <h2><a href="/kids">Reflections on whether I should have kids</a></h2>
      <div class="date">2025-01-04</div>
      <p>I've recently been experiencing the phenomenon of, 'baby fever', after some enlightening encounters with Sarah and her daughter Emma. 
        At a Christmas party, I watched, captivated, as Emma attempted to crack an imaginary egg on the piano. 
        What struck me most was Sarah's parenting approach - she'd thoughtfully explain cause and effect when things didn't go as Emma expected.</p>

        <p>I have now lived in Glasgow for four months. Through an unexpected stroke of fortune, Tom offered me a room in his flat when I had nowhere else to go. I sorted my life into what would fit in a few bags, leaving behind cherished possessions like my heated air dryer. My last day in Bristol was spent at a swing dancing night called "Ain't Misbehavin'." It felt like a fitting way to end things. I felt at home with the dancing community in Bristol, and it was perhaps my last chance to enjoy it. On my way back from the night, I was chatting to someone who grew up in Edinburgh and was giving me the lowdown on Glasgow. "It's got a good music scene. Watch out for the stabbings though," they said with a half-smile. Having moved out of my place, I returned to my friend's bed sometime after 1 AM. It felt like an emotionally significant moment in my life. I did not sleep; instead, I wandered around the very quiet streets near my alma mater. Taking it all in. Drinking from an endless vase. Never quite satisfied. A coach at 7 AM took me to Scotland that same day.</p>

    <h2><a href="/vegan">Militant Vegan</a></h2>
    <div class="date">2024-11-22</div>
    <p>A friend told me about militant vegans. How they make everyone feel bad from their moral high ground. I used to be one. With friends who thought the same, it was easy. I spent hours using philosophical jiu-jitsu to convert people.</p>
    <p>Then I wondered - does this actually help? Some googling and talking showed me the truth. My veganism barely dents the system. The factory farms keep running either way. So I dropped the crusade.</p>

    <div class="date">2024-11-19</div>
    <p>Some days, Tom speaks about fighting battles we know we'll lose. Like his quest to end all suffering in our world, human and non-human alike. We lose this battle every single day, he and I. Yet we keep fighting, because we must.</p>
    <p>Another battle worth fighting is against life's suboptimal parts. And oh, how suboptimal the internet has become. The endless ads, mind-numbing short-form content, waves of misinformation - it's exhausting. I dream of a more wholesome internet. One where I can simply read my friends' thoughts without ads force-fed into my consciousness. Where disagreements with strangers can unfold with nuance and empathy. This version of the internet - this is worth fighting for. And so I joined Bluesky.</p>

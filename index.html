        <p>Dear Arjun,</p>

        <p>
          Congratulations on surviving your first month of university. Few more to go now. 
          Here's some, perhaps 'cliché' advice for you.
        </p>

        <p>
          For a long time, I repressed a lot of my sexuality. Mostly out of fear. 
          Sometimes out of confusion.

        <h2><a href="/blog/bike">I learnt to ride a bike</a></h2>
        <div class="date">2024-10-13</div>
          <p> I did it!
            I learnt how to balance on a bike.
            It has taken many decades to get here.
            Two in fact.</p>
            
            <p> My father had long tried to get me to ride a bike.
            But I was too afraid to fall.
            I would ask for assisted wheels on either side to help me stay balanced.
            The bike shops we went to would look at us funny.
            'Why does this teenager need assisted wheels?'
            They would say. 
            I gave up hope on ever learning to ride a bike as a kid.
            Who cares anyways?
            I can use my feet.</p>

        <div class="date">2024-09-01</div>
        <p>
          Gaurav isn’t the name I was born with. I began to dislike my original
          name, so I decided to adopt my father’s first name. But that doesn’t
          make me Gaurav Yadav Jr.; it just means both my dad and I are Gaurav
          Yadav. What a treat!

        <p>
          Tom and I have been pondering how to make friends as adults. One
          solution he has invented is CultFrisbee™. Here's how you play:
        </p>

        <h3>Rules:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You need at least one other player.</li>
          <li>Before catching a frisbee, you must clap.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Within a space of ten by ten,<br />
          You can dance solo or bring a friend.<br />
          Throw shapes and moves with all your might,<br />
          From swing to waltz, your steps can be right.<br />
          Break dance or hip hop, give it a shot,<br />
          In this square, you've got the perfect spot.
        </p>

        <p>
          Though if you're aiming to groove across the floor,<br />
          A ten-by-ten just leaves you wanting more.<br />
          If setting the mood is your goal,<br />
          That square footage might cramp your soul.

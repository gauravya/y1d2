        <div class="date">2025-02-20</div>
        <p>In my early teens, I dreamt of becoming a photographer.</p>

          crack an imaginary egg on the piano.

          I have now lived in Glasgow for four months. Through an unexpected
          stroke of fortune, Tom offered me a room in his flat when I had
          nowhere else to go...

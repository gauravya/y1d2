        <div class="date">2024-09-01</div>
        <p>
          Gaurav isn’t the name I was born with. I began to dislike my original
          name, so I decided to adopt my father’s first name. But that doesn’t
          make me Gaurav Yadav Jr.; it just means both my dad and I are Gaurav
          Yadav. What a treat!

          Tom and I have been pondering how to make friends as adults. One
          solution he has invented is CultFrisbee™. Here's how you play:

        <h3>Rules:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You need at least one other player.</li>
          <li>Before catching a frisbee, you must clap.</li>

          Within a space of ten by ten,<br />
          You can dance solo or bring a friend.<br />
          Throw shapes and moves with all your might,<br />
          From swing to waltz, your steps can be right.<br />
          Break dance or hip hop, give it a shot,<br />
          In this square, you've got the perfect spot.
        </p>

        <p>
          Though if you're aiming to groove across the floor,<br />
          A ten-by-ten just leaves you wanting more.<br />
          If setting the mood is your goal,<br />
          That square footage might cramp your soul.

        <h2><a href="/blog/backpacking">Vegan Backpacking</a></h2>
        <div class="date">2024-07-16</div>
        <p>
          I recently hauled myself on a 20-day trek through the Slovakian and Polish mountains. 
          My 65-L backpack tipped the airport scales at a whopping 18 kg. Jack got stuck with our 
          shared tent, first aid kit, and other group gear, so it's safe to say most of my pack 
          weight was, you guessed it, food.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am going to talk a bit about food for backpacking here. This was my first time doing 
          something like this, and so I am by no means an expert and have a bunch to learn. It is 
          also worth noting that I am not a nutritionist, and everyone's bodies and specifically 
          their guts are different.

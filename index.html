     A friend told me about militant vegans.
        How they make everyone feel bad from their moral high ground.
        I used to be one.
        With friends who thought the same, it was easy.
        I spent hours using philosophical jiu-jitsu to convert people.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then I wondered - does this actually help?
        Some googling and talking showed me the truth.
        My veganism barely dents the system.
        The factory farms keep running either way.
        So I dropped the crusade.

     Some days, Tom speaks about fighting battles we know we'll lose.
            Like his quest to end all suffering in our world, human and non-human alike.
            We lose this battle every single day, he and I.
            Yet we keep fighting, because we must.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another battle worth fighting is against life's suboptimal parts.
              And oh, how suboptimal the internet has become.
              The endless ads, mind-numbing short-form content, waves of misinformation - it's exhausting.
              I dream of a more wholesome internet.
              One where I can simply read my friends' thoughts without ads force-fed into my consciousness.
              Where disagreements with strangers can unfold with nuance and empathy.
              This version of the internet - this is worth fighting for.
              And so I joined Bluesky.

     Friends are sharing more writing online these days.
          This brings me joy - I fully support them putting their words into the world.
          Reading about their lives feels like keeping them close, since I rarely see a lot of them anymore.
          This has me reflecting on my own internet writing habits.
    </p>
    <p>
     At seventeen, I launched my first blog called "Keeping Pace." 
          I gave it the tagline: "Helping your life become 1% better."
          How ambitious of me!
          My anxious teenage mind found comfort in self-help books.
          I started echoing those ideas to other seventeen-year-olds.

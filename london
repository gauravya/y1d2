          <h2>House me in London?</h2>

          <p>Edit: Looking for place for the month of March now!</p>

          <p>
            The tradition of "date-me" documents is well established.
            But currently, I must find a roof before I can find love, so how about a "house-me" document?
            This short page details my housing needs. If you like my vibe my email is gauraventh (at) gmail (dot) com          
          </p>

          <p>
            I have been accepted as an AI Governance Fellow at Pivotal Research.
            I'll likely work on questions surrounding AI Governance and the Law.

            I am looking for housing near the LISA office in Shoreditch.
            My budget is Â£1000, but I'd love to come in under that.
            If necessary, I'm happy to pay a little more.
            The dates I'm looking for are 1st February to 6th April.

            I'd love to live in a space with a sense of community.
            Group meals, activities, and shared experiences are very important to me.
            I am agentic and extroverted in this regard.
            I love doing things with others.
            Living with people who share this vibe would be ideal.
          </p>

          <h2>What am I like to live with?</h2>

          <p>I really value having a nice home environment.
            I keep things spotless - you won't find dishes lingering in the sink or mess in shared spaces.
            But more than cleanliness, I believe in creating life in shared spaces.
            I love hosting (vegan) dinner gatherings - a tradition I cherished during university.
            Dancing is a big part of my life too.
            I'll be hitting up London's folk and swing dancing scenes.
            I'd love to introduce you to this world!
            Community is at the heart of my ideal home.
            I thrive on shared meals, long conversations, and creating bonds with flatmates.
            My past flatmates have become close friends - that's the kind of connection I value.
            Don't worry if you're not as community-focused!
            I'm happy living with more independent people too.
            Just know I might spend more time exploring London in that case.
          </p>

          <h2>What does my current housemate think of me?</h2>
          <p>
          Tom Gardiner:
          
          <blockquote>"[They're] open to suggestions and very amenable to live with.
          They don't have a disruptive lifestyle.
          One flaw: a terrible wrap-folding technique!
          (We often make tofu and veggie wraps, and they don't fold them tightly enough!)"

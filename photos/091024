            Cute couple (?) on my walk. 
            I asked them if they were okay with me taking their photo. 
            They said, "Should we do anything?" 
            I said, "Give me some pazza!" 
            Kidding. I said, "Continue as you were!"

            An abandoned bike. 
            I intend to photograph this frequently.

        <p>
            Tom really loves his balcony. 
            He used to sit, ponder, drink a beverage and enjoy the sun.
            Of course, it is Glasgow. 
            The sun is hardly to be seen here.
            As such this was a rare moment of catching Tom taking in the moment.
        </p>

        <p>
            Out from the balcony you can see the West End.
            The bougie part of Glasgow.
            It is where the pretty people are.
            It is where I spend most of my time.
            If you ever visit Glasgow you must visit the West End.

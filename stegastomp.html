            <p><a href="https://stegastomp.co.uk">Stegastomp</a> has come and gone, leaving behind memories of a raucous (!) contra dance weekend in a charming village hall near Warwick. The event featured incredible music by Contrasaurus and their many friends, a band I've since learned has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCgZTKeGxFg">playing for quite some time</a>.</p>

            <p>This year marks my first foray into folk festivals. Having only discovered folk music and dancing last year, I was initially hesitant to dive into the festival scene. However, I've now experienced my first <a href="https://ivfdf2024.org.uk/">IVFDF</a> in York, my first <a href="https://www.chippfolk.co.uk/">Chippenham Folk Festival</a>, and now Stegastomp. With each event, I feel more connected to this vibrant community.</p>

            <p>The journey to Stegastomp began with Jeremy kindly offering a lift to the village hall. Our two-hour drive was pleasantly interrupted by a Thai stew I had cooked, which we enjoyed at a service station. Upon arrival, we were immediately swept into the festivities, with music and dancing already in full swing.</p>

            <p>As I've engaged more with the UK folk world, I've come to appreciate certain aspects. People tend to be refreshingly direct, yet loving in their own way. There's a palpable sense of free self-expression that permeates the community. Of course, being new means encountering the 'newcomer syndrome' - that awkward feeling of being surrounded by people who all seem to know each other. The solution? Keep showing up. Eventually, people start to recognise you, ask for your name, and you become part of the fabric.</p>

            <p>It's clear that many have been part of the folk scene for years, even decades, with friendships spanning just as long. This realisation initially made me feel out of place at Stegastomp, but I'm learning that becoming part of this community is a gradual process like everything else.</p>

            <p>The weekend itself was exceptionally well organised. Charlotte, who runs Stegastomp, clearly knows her stuff – everything ran like a well-oiled machine. The folk community's direct communication style seems to contribute to this efficiency.</p>

            <p>The calling and music were fantastic. As someone who's been dancing for a while, I found the calling easy to follow, though I wonder how newcomers fared with some of the trickier dances. Dancing with seasoned partners was a treat, making it easier to experiment with flourishes and role-switching. I particularly appreciated that this was a gender-free calling event, contrasting with my experience at Chippenham, where gendered calling sometimes caused confusion. While I prefer gender-free calling, I understand why those accustomed to years of gendered calling might find the Larks/Robins system challenging. I'm looking forward to experiencing Louise Siddons' positional calling at the next Stegastomp.</p>

            <p>The evenings featured tune sessions where people brought instruments and played, accompanied by balfolk dancing. I still struggle with some balfolk dances like the mazurka, however, I've gotten the hang of other dance forms. What's nice about Bal is that it is a lot more free-form and improvisational – it's okay to mess up and get back on beat. The sessions would go on until midnight, which I found a bit challenging on Saturday when I was ready for sleep. As I was indoor camping, and the tunes were happening in the same place, it made for some late nights.</p>

            <p>Saturday's workshops were excellent, offering both familiar material (like Charlie's workshop on connection) and challenging new experiences. Sunday's Playford workshop was less to my taste – I found the dances somewhat rigid and struggled to connect with them. However, the contra medley was a highlight, featuring an impressive hour and a half of non-stop dancing!</p>

            <p>I even got to try my hand at calling, leading the "Square Affair" by Becky Hill. I really enjoy calling – it feels like a skill that's fun to try and master. I asked around to see where I could have a go at calling more often and got some pretty good advice.</p>

            <p>Overall, Stegastomp was a lovely experience – an affordable contra festival packed with dancing. I'm already looking forward to next year!</p>
